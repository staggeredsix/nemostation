This is a long-run session: aim for a 10–20 minute walkthrough with detailed checkpoints and multi-file artifacts. Provide:\n- Backend CRUD endpoints with models, schemas, and router layout.\n- Minimal HTML UI (Jinja or static) to list/create incidents.\n- Tests (pytest) for core CRUD flows.\n- Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml.\n- Makefile with setup, test, run, docker-build.\nCheckpoints: (1) scaffold files, (2) implement backend endpoints, (3) implement UI, (4) run tests, (5) docker build/run. If playground tools are enabled, emit JSON tool requests like:\n```json\n{\"tool\":\"playground.exec\",\"cmd\":[\"bash\",\"-lc\",\"pytest -q\"],\"timeout_s\":120}\n```\nUse tool outputs to fix errors until tests pass and docker builds. End with a concise handoff summary.\n"
